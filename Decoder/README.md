<h1>Goals of writing the code:</h1>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of writing this code was to solve the challenge from ThriveDX consisting of decoding the coded flag.</li>
<li>Additionally, I wanted to write the Python code, that automatically solve this task.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Use:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Just type <code>python3 my_decoder.py</code>code></li>
<li>Enter encoded string (be careful not to copy spaces or other characters): 50ee074e527c3abc3980df55ea13f62788c74542c45b5efc27a4a11f7e6c1ad87bb6af1fe217e81b76248ae78f6b84</li>
<li>Press Enter.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Notice:</h1>h1>
<div>
<p>I can't provide the encoder code because I'm not its author and besides, it's part of a task available only to registered users.</p>
  <p>But there are no contraindications to writing your own encoder based on my decoder, just as I wrote the discussed decoder based on the encoder :)</p>

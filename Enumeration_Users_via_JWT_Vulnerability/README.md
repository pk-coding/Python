<h1>Goals of writing the code:</h1>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of writing this code was to solve one of the tasks of a certain job offer.</li>
<li>Uses NONE Algorithm Vulnerability to obtain the name of user.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Use:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Enter address of your Proxy ( if you have proxy i.e. Burp Suite) or delete this option in line 9.</li>
<li>Enter URL address in line 17. You have to enter another endpoint. This endpint is for illustration purposes only.</li>
<li>You probably have to change names of parameters in line 18 and 21.</li>
<li>You have to change names of parameters in line 33.</li>
<li>Type in your terminal: <code>python3 enumeration_users_via_jwt_and_response_lenght.py</code></li>
</ul>
<h1>Background:</h1>
<p>In this case I know the password:testing and I try to find a user using The JWT None algorithm attack.</p>
<ol>
<li>1. Each response has 573 length.</li>
<li>2. One response has more than 573 length and it is 604.</li>
<li>3. Response which has more than 573 length is marked by "SUPER" word to easier find it.</li>
<li>4. There is a link to "app.js" file in the text of response, which contains a flag to solve the task.</li>
</ol>
